# Platformer Game

## INTRO/BACKGROUND: 

This is a platformer game in which the player needs to collect coins in a certain time limit. I was inspired to make this game
after watching a platformer game tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icd2gAHDSfY) and, of course, after playing Mario. 

## HOW TO PLAY:

- use WASD or Arrow Keys to move around
- R to reset if the coin spawns in a place that is impossible to grab(bug I need to fix)
- jump around and collect coins
- don't get hit by enemies
- HAVE FUN

## TO DO:
- make multiple coins appear at the same time
- Add replay button
- Add more levels
- add power ups
  - jump boost
  - size increase
  - speed increase
- add home screen/pause screen
- fix bug with coin spawning location initially
