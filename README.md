# PlatformerGame

## INTRO/BACKGROUND: 

This is a platformer game in which the player needs to collect coins in a certain time limit. I was inspired to make this game
after watching a platformer game tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icd2gAHDSfY). 

## HOW TO PLAY:

- use WASD to move around
- R to reset
- jump around and collect coins
- don't get hit by enemies
- HAVE FUN

## TO DO:
- make enemies
- make multiple coins appear at the same time
- Add replay button
- Add more levels
- add sprites to game instead of just squares for player, walls, and enemy
- add power ups
  - jump boost
  - size increase
  - speed increase
- add home screen/pause screen
